  <h2><a name="Scope">Scope of This Document</a> </h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This guide is intended for day-to-day use of the TOS console. For
  information on running and administering a TOS system, see the <a
  HREF="Administrator.html">Administrator&#146;s Guide</a> . For information on developing
  applications to run under TOS, see the Developer&#146;s Guide. For a technical overview of
  TOS design, implementation, internal structure, and possible extensions, see Tyrone&#146;s
  Operating System: An Educational Operating System in Java. </p>
  <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction to TOS</a> </h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tyrone&#146;s Operating System, TOS, was prepared as a thesis for COSC
  4F90 at Brock University. It is intended to be used in senior-year undergraduate courses
  in operating system implementation.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOS is a distributed operating system. Unlike conventional operating
  systems, which run on only one computer, TOS can run on any number of different computers
  simultaneously, as long as they are connected over a network running the TCP/IP protocol
  suite. All the computers running TOS will share a common file system and common access to
  the same system objects. Programs running on one computer can coordinate their activities
  and send information to programs on another quickly and easily.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another difference between most operating systems is that TOS is not a
  native operating system. It is not booted by a computer when it is turned on and it does
  not deal directly with the computer&#146;s hardware. Instead, it runs on top of the
  computer&#146;s native operating system. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The basic modules enabling you to use TOS have been prepared for the
  UNIX family, Microsoft Windows 95/NT, and the Macintosh System 7.6 or later. </p>
  <h2><a name="Connecting">Connecting to TOS</a> </h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: Currently the TOS console is not supported on the Macintosh. See
  the <a href="final.html">Final Report</a> for an explanation of the technical reasons for
  this.</p>
  <h3><a name="JAVA">JAVA Environment Variable</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The JAVA environment variable must be set to the name of the executable
  containing the console version of the Java run-time engine. If you are using the Sun JDK
  or JRE, you may use either &quot;java&quot; or &quot;jre&quot; for this variable. If you
  are using the Microsoft VM for Java, use &quot;jview&quot;, located in your Windows
  directory. Do not use the windowed versions of the run-time engine, such as
  &quot;javaw&quot; or &quot;wjview&quot;.</p>
  <h3><a name="CLASSPATH">CLASSPATH Environment Variable </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your CLASSPATH environment variable must also point to the same
  directory containing the TOS executables. This directory will contain a subdirectory
  called tos which contains the Java class files that implement TOS. Make sure that your
  CLASSPATH points to the parent of tos, not to tos itself.</p>
  <h3><a name="startcon">Starting the Console</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To start the TOS console, simply type Console at any command-line
  prompt. You may also make use of any other method your host offers for starting
  applications, such as creating a desktop shortcut in Windows or an alias in UNIX.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will see a command-line prompt saying simply TOS:&gt;. This is the
  TOS prompt. From here, you can enter commands simply by typing the command name, its
  parameters, and &lt;enter&gt; or &lt;return&gt;.</p>
  <h3><a name="conlaunch">Connecting a Console to a Launcher</a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will not be able enter any commands in TOS (except exit) without
  connecting to a launcher. The syntax for doing this is:</p>
  <i><p>connect host[:port]</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">where host refers to either the qualified network name or IP address or
  the machine running a TOS launcher, and port refers to the TCP/IP port number the launcher
  is running on. If you do not specify a port number, it will default to 1099.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So if you are connecting to a launcher running on port 1101 of a host
  with IP address 139.57.96.16, you would enter </p>
  <i><p>connect spartan.ac.brocku.ca:1101</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you were running on a machine called sandcastle and wished to
  connect to a launcher also running on sandcastle, on port 1105, enter</p>
  <i><p>connect sandcastle:1105</i> </p>
  <h3><a name="dynamic">Dynamic TCP/IP Addressing</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The machine running the launcher you are connecting to must be linked
  to the one you are running the console from on a network supporting TCP/IP. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that machine uses dynamic TCP/IP addressing, which is generally the
  case for machines using a dial-up network connecting, and often also for PC or Macintosh
  workstations, you must make sure that the IP address you are using corresponds to the one
  in use at the time. This may preclude using the connect command in a script file.</p>
  <h3><a name="Reconnection">Reconnection </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you wish during a single console session to connect to a different
  launcher, or even if you need to reconnect to the first because it crashed and was
  restarted, you must use the disconnect command before running connect again. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is because each connection to a launcher does not persist across
  different execution instances of the launcher. If the launcher stops, you must disconnect
  and connect again.</p>
  <h2><a name="fileSystem">The TOS File System</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="Single">Single Global Namespace</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOS&#146; file system is based largely on the UNIX model. There can be
  any number disk servers on different machines within the TOS system, but system
  administrators may mount different disks to any directory path (see the <a
  HREF="Administrator.html">Administrator&#146;s Guide</a> for further details). The overall
  effect is to resemble a single large virtual disk. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is in contrast to Microsoft and Apple operating systems, where
  every path name includes a reference to the physical disk partition on which a file is
  located.</p>
  <h3><a name="Directories">Directories</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in UNIX, there is a central root directory referred to as /. From
  there, a hierarchical tree structure of directories is laid out, using / as the path
  separator. There is no fixed limit on the number of files within any single directory,
  other than the limits applicable to the physical disk the file or directory is actually
  located on (see below).</p>
  <h3><a name="FileNames">File Names</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can refer to a file by either its absolute path name or its
  relative path name, the name comparable to your working directory. This follows the same
  conventions as in both UNIX and MS-DOS. So a file named foo located in directory mydir has
  the absolute path name /mydir/foo. If you are in the directory otherdir, another
  subdirectory of root, you may use the .. operator to refer to your immediate parent. In
  that case foo&#146;s path, relative to you, becomes ../mydir/foo. A file myfile located in
  otherdir can be simply referred to as myfile (relative) or /otherdir/myfile.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Files may have a maximum of 255 characters in their names. TOS will not
  stop you from creating two files in the same directory with the same name, but if you do
  you will not be able to access the second file until you move or rename the first.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">File names may not contain either the path separator character (/) or
  the colon (:) character, which TOS uses for internal operations. Spaces also will not be
  recognized as part of a filename and will result in a syntax error. You are also advised
  not to use the path separator character for your host (\ on Windows).</p>
  <h3><a name="Physical">Physical Disk Servers</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may often find that files are unavailable. The most common reason
  for this is that the TOS disk server in which the file&#146;s directory is mounted is no
  longer running. You will not be able to access the file until it is started again. See the
  <a HREF="Administrator.html">Administrator&#146;s Guide</a> for instructions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the disks has a limit on both the overall quantity of data it
  can hold and the number of files it can hold. These restrictions serve as the only limits
  on the size of any individual file or directory &#150; neither can grow so large as to
  break their disk&#146;s limits. System administrators set these limits when the disk is
  created (see the <a HREF="Administrator.html">Administrator&#146;s Guide</a> ). They can
  view this information later but not change it.</p>
  <h3><a name="filetypes">Types of Files </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Files can contain binary or character data. Character files use the
  Unicode character encoding system, which supports a wide variety of human languages, each
  with its range of symbols and accents.</p>
  <h2><a name="Security">Security in the File System</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="passwords">Entering Passwords</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Security in TOS is based on assigning passwords to files. Any user can
  issue a password on a file. The command to do this is:</p>
  <i><p>protect filename [oldpassword]</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You must enter the correct value for oldpassword if the file already
  has a password. If it does not, omit this parameter.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will then be prompted for a new password. The new password may be
  of any length and may use any combination of characters except spaces. The password
  characters are not hidden on the screen, so be sure your enemies aren&#146;t watching.</p>
  <h3><a name="removing">Removing Passwords </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To remove a password, simply use protect and leave the new password
  blank when prompted to enter one.</p>
  <h3><a name="FilePermissions">File Permissions </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have placed a password on a file, you may select the
  file&#146;s permissions. These permissions place limits on what users can do with the file
  without entering its password. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Read permission enables users to be able to read the contents of the
  file. They can access the file&#146;s contents but may not change its contents.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Write permission enables users to change the contents of the file. This
  includes being able to completely overwrite its contents if they wish.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Execute permission is relevant only to Java class files and TOS script
  files. It enables the class files or scripts to be run from the TOS console.</p>
  <h3><a name="Settings">Setting Permissions</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Merely choosing a password does not, by itself, have an effect on the
  ability of other users to access a file without knowing the password. You must set the
  file&#146;s permission bits, which again follow the model of UNIX. The syntax is:</p>
  <i><p>chmod filename permissions password</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The permissions parameter is a logical OR of three bits. The left-most
  bit represents read permission, the middle bit is write permission, and the right-most bit
  is for execute permission.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the uninitiated in bitwise arithmetic, here are the values to be
  used for difference combinations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>0 &#150; None </li>
    <li>1 &#150; Execute only </li>
    <li>2 &#150; Write only </li>
    <li>3 &#150; Write and execute </li>
    <li>4 &#150; Read only </li>
    <li>5 &#150; Read and execute </li>
    <li>6 &#150; Read and write </li>
    <li>7 &#150; Read, write, and execute </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Values 8 and above will produce an error message. </p>
  <h3><a name="Accessing">Accessing a Protected File </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the file&#146;s permissions permit the operation you wish to
  execute, you do not need to enter a password when accessing the file. If they do, the last
  parameter in the command you enter must be the password.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider trying to use the export command on a file named myfile, with
  password mypassword, that has write-only permission. Export requires read permission,
  which the file doesn&#146;t have. So the user must supply its password, as follows:</p>
  <i><p>export myfile hostfile mypassword</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(See the section Importing and Exporting Files for details on export.)</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: TOS does not yet make use of passwords for operations involving
  more than one file, that is copy and move. Files being copied and moved must be left
  unprotected in the current version of TOS.</p>
  <h2><a name="Navigating">Navigating in TOS</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="Working">Working Directory</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your current working directory will be contained within the TOS prompt.
  It will be prepended to any non-absolute pathname you enter for any command. </p>
  <h3><a name="Moving">Moving Around </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change the working directory using the cd command. TOS will
  automatically locate the correct TOS disk server and connect you to it behind the scenes
  if it is available. If it is not, you will not be able to complete the cd operation and a
  warning message will appear. As always, you may use either absolute or relative names to
  move around.</p>
  <h3><a name="Basic">Basic File Operations </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Copy</em>, or <em>cp</em>, creates a second copy of a file at
  another location.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Move</em>, or <em>mv</em>, creates a copy of a file at another
  location and deletes the original file.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Delete</em>, or <em>del</em>, or <em>rm</em>, deletes a file. Write
  permission is required.</p>
  <h3><a name="Directory">Directory Operations</a> </h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Mkdir</em>, or <em>md</em>, creates a directory.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><em>Rmdir</em>, or <em>rd</em>, removes a directory.&nbsp; The
  directory must already be empty.</p>
  <h3><a name="Editing">Editing Files in TOS </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can use the edit command to invoke the TOS editor. This is a GUI
  program, so it may only be used if you have access to a windowing environment, which rules
  out running it from a telnet session. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The author of TOS, curse him, intended the editor only for quick edits.
  As a result, it has deliberately been left primitive, with not even basic facilities such
  as cut, copy, and paste. You may type, change text, and save, nothing more. If you quit
  the editor without saving, you will be prompted to save your file.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because text files in TOS are stored in Unicode format, you may use any
  human language supported by Unicode, as long as your host&#146;s keyboard and video
  display permit it. See the Unicode Web site (<a HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org</a>)
  for a complete list of Unicode-supported languages.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Write permission is required to edit a file.</p>
  <h2><a name="Compiling">Compiling and Running Java Programs for TOS</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="Selecting">Selecting a Compiler </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOS does not contain a Java compiler; you will have to make use of one
  from your host machine. Before doing this you must tell TOS where on your host your
  compiler is located. Use the regcomp command for this. You may enter the command in any
  form that would execute successfully from the same host directory from where you launched
  TOS.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For instance, if the Sun javac compiler is already is your PATH
  variable, you could enter simply</p>
  <i><p>regcomp javac</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you need to use the Microsoft jvc compiler from a directory not in
  your path, you might enter something like</p>
  <i><p>regcomp d:\DevStudio\VJ98\bin\jvc.exe</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note: TOS does not handle host filenames with space characters, as
  Windows does. You may wish to make use of batch files to get around this.</p>
  <h3><a name="source">Compiling Java Source Files </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have registered a host compiler, you may run it with the javac
  command. Note that javac does not mean that the host compiler must have that name; as
  explained in the preceding section, any Java compiler on the host may be used. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The syntax is:</p>
  <p><em>javac filename[.java] [parameters]</em></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The source file must have the extension .java, but this can be omitted
  from the command.&nbsp; The remaining parameters will be passed to the host compiler.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The compiler will execute in the directory on your host from which you
  started the TOS console. You must ensure that the CLASSPATH variable on your host includes
  the paths of any Java packages you are importing, including the TOS packages.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">See the Developer&#146;s Guide for information on writing Java
  applications for TOS.</p>
  <h3><a name="running">Running Java Programs </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Use the Run command to run a Java class file. You may run the class
  either in the foreground, so that its standard input and output map to the console, or in
  the background, completely separate from the console.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note, however, that in either case TOS exports the file to the
  directory on your host from which you ran the TOS console and runs the class from there,
  using the executable on your host contained in your host&#146;s JAVA environment variable.
  You must make sure that any classes referenced in your applications are contained in your
  host&#146;s CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although TOS will export the actual files you will be using, it does
  not export any supporting classes you have written. These must be exported in advance to a
  location in your host&#146;s CLASSPATH.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may not use package names. Java classes to be run from TOS must be
  part of an anonymous package. Use of a package name will cause a run-time error from your
  host Java interpreter.</p>
  <h2><a name="importing">Importing and Exporting Files from TOS to Your Host</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="text">Text and Binary Modes </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOS text files are stored using the Unicode convention, which uses two
  bytes per character. TOS will, however, take care of translating between Unicode and the
  default text encoding system of your host. On both UNIX and English-language versions of
  Windows, this is ASCII.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This does mean, however, that when importing or exporting a file you
  must specify whether it is a binary or text file.</p>
  <h3><a name="fileimport">Importing Files </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To import a file, use the import command:</p>
  <p><em>import host-source-name tos-destination-name mode [password]</em></p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You must have write permission on the TOS file tos-destination, and be
  able to read the host file host-source. Indicate either &quot;text&quot; or
  &quot;binary&quot; as the mode parameter. There is no default, so if the mode is omitted
  you will receive an error message.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Host filenames are relative to the directory from which you ran the TOS
  console.</p>
  <h3><a name="fileexport">Exporting Files </a></h3>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To export a file, use the export command:</p>
  <i><p>export tos-source host-destination mode [password]</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You must have read permission on the TOS file tos-destination, and be
  able to write to the host file host-destination. Indicate either &quot;text&quot; or
  &quot;binary&quot; as a the mode parameter. There is no default, so if the mode is omitted
  you will receive an error message.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Host filenames are relative to the directory from which you ran the TOS
  console.</p>
  <h2><a name="script">TOS Script Files </a></h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TOS has the ability to place multiple commands in a single text file
  and execute them as a group. A script file must have the extension .scr. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To run a script file, type</p>
  <i><p>exec script-filename[.scr] [password]</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually typing the .scr extension is optional. You must have execute
  permission on the script file in order to run it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike MS-DOS batch files or UNIX shell scripts, you may only use
  actual TOS commands in a script file. There are no operators or other statements
  permitted.</p>
  <h2><a name="exit">Exiting TOS </a></h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exit TOS with the <em>exit</em> command. You do not need to disconnect
  before doing this.</p>
  <h2><a name="command">TOS Command Summary</a> </h2>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those TOS commands that have counterparts in MS-DOS and the UNIX shells
  usually may be executed using either name for convenience. Thus, <em>copy</em> and <em>cp</em>
  have the same effect, as do <em>move</em> and <em>mv</em>, <em>dir</em> and <em>ls</em>
  etc.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note, though, that only the UNIX / character may be used as a path
  separator. The \ character (the MS-DOS path separator) is just another character in TOS.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The TOS console is case-sensitive throughout.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parameters listed within brackets [] are optional.</p>
  <h3>chmod</h3>
  <p><i>chmod filename permissions password</i></p>
  <p>Change permissions on a file. </p>
  <p><i>filename</i> - Name of file<br>
  <i>permissions</i>&#150; New permissions<br>
  <i>password</i>&#150; Password. May not be blank. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>connect</h3>
  <p>connect host[:port]</p>
  <p>Connect to a TOS launcher. </p>
  <p><i>host</i>&#150; Name or IP address of a launcher to connect to.<br>
  <i>port</i> &#150; TCP/IP port the launcher is running on at the host.&nbsp; Defaults to
  1099.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>copy </h3>
  <p><i>copy source-file destination-file<br>
  cp source-file destination-file</i></p>
